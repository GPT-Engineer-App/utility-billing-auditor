Please center this code in html, javascript and css aelectric utility billings auditor, that can analyze and track electric  and gas usage over the past year. This could be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses to monitor their utility costs and identify potential areas for savings.

To begin, we would need to gather and integrate historical utility bill data from the past 12 months. This data would include details such as billing period, usage in kWh for electricity and therms for gas.

Next, we would develop algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns or anomalies in utility usage and costs. This could involve comparing usage trends month-over-month, identifying peak usage periods, and detecting any sudden spikes in consumption that may indicate inefficiencies or issues.

Additionally, we could incorporate machine learning models to predict future utility costs based on historical data, helping users anticipate and budget for upcoming bills more accurately.

Furthermore, we could add features such as customizable alerts for unusual usage patterns, recommendations for energy-saving measures, and cost-saving tips based on the analysis of the data.

the user will manually enter the past 12 months billing in the proper column ,their name, account number, address, city, state and zip code. The auditor will anaylzed the billing and check for errors and print out a report. create a column named Start Gas Meter Read Date 1, create column named total therms used.
